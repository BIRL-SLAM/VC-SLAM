# VC-SLAM: Cloud-edge VSLAM with Efficient Transmission based on Variable-Order Chebyshev-KAN
### Project Composition
The construction of this project includes three parts, with two parts on the edge side (Cloud-Edge-SLAM and Udf-Edge) and one part on the cloud side (Cloud-SLAM). 
### ROS Dependency
All three parts are built based on ROS, so when executing this project, it is recommended to ensure that ROS is installed on the edge cloud computer, preferably with a consistent version.
