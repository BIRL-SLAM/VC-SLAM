# VC-SLAM: Cloud-edge VSLAM with Efficient Transmission based on Variable-Order Chebyshev-KAN
### To briefly introduce, the code is divided into three parts, with two parts on the edge side (Cloud-Edge-SLAM and Udf-Edge) and one part on the cloud side (Cloud-SLAM). 
### All three parts are built based on ROS, so when executing this project, it is recommended to ensure that ROS is installed on the edge cloud computer, preferably with a consistent version.
